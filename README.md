# Introduction
Our project aims to predict stock market trends using sentiment analysis of tweets. The sentiment of tweets related to a company will be analyzed and processed using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The processed data will then be used to train an XGBoost model to make predictions about the stock market trends of the company. The ultimate goal is to improve accuracy in stock market predictions by incorporating social media sentiment analysis.
